# Remote control cover

One day I found a weird plastic piece and I threw it out. I had been using a
programable multi remote for a while so I never noticed it came from my tv
remote!! Now that I have a 3D printer, and my multi-remote is starting to show
its age, I figured I would print out a new cover.

# Verions

| Version | Changes | Results |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 0.1     | Initial | some measurements were off, eg: cover was 24mm wide, but the interior should have been 24mm |
| 0.2     | Widened body to 24mm interior, modified release clip. |  Body not deep enough, missing a little on the width (.5mm), release clip too thick. Holding clips too thick. Not long enough |
| 0.3     | Reduced the of the thickness of the clips and the release, made clips shorter, increased the with a little. increased length 2mm |  Forgot to widen the body! Also 6mm is too high. Clips are great. There is also a slight curve between the body and the case on the release clip end |
| 0.4    |  Widened body by 1mm -> 25mm. Shortened from 6mm back to 5mm. Added a curve on the sides on the end of the retainer.|  Release clip pushes down too much. Corner curve is not big enough. |
| 0.5    | Increase radius to 0.75mm. thicken release clip by 1mm and move the rest inwards so clip is bellow cover line. |  Not Printed Yet |
