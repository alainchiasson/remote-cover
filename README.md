# Remote control cover

One day I found a weird plastic piece and I threw it out. I had been using a
programable multi remote for a while so I never noticed it came from my tv
remote!! Now that I have a 3D printer, and my multi-remote is starting to show
its age, I figured I would print out a new cover.

# Verions

0.1 Initial. After printing found a few measurements that were off. For example,
I put the cover at 24 mm wide - but it is the INSIDE which should be 24 mm wide.

0.2  widdened the body to have a 24mm interior.
